## Question 12: Recreate `setTimeout()` from scratch

### **Problem Statement**

The JavaScript `setTimeout()` function allows you to execute a function after a specified delay. The challenge here is to recreate the behavior of `setTimeout()` from scratch without using the built-in `setTimeout()`.

---

### **Custom Implementation**

We can achieve this by using JavaScriptâ€™s `Date` object and `setInterval()` for periodic checks to simulate a timeout.

```javascript
function customSetTimeout(callback, delay) {
  const start = Date.now(); // Record the start time
  
  const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
    const elapsed = Date.now() - start; // Calculate elapsed time
    if (elapsed >= delay) {
      clearInterval(intervalId); // Stop the interval once delay is met
      callback(); // Execute the callback function
    }
  }, 1); // Check every millisecond
}
```
How It Works
1. Record the Start Time:
   * Use Date.now() to capture the timestamp at the moment the function is called.
     
2. Use setInterval for Polling:
   * Repeatedly check the elapsed time by calculating the difference between the current time and the start time.
     
3. Stop the Interval:
   * Once the elapsed time equals or exceeds the specified delay, clear the interval using clearInterval().
  
4. Execute the Callback
  * Call the provided callback function after the delay.

Example Usage
```javascript
customSetTimeout(() => {
  console.log("This message is displayed after 2 seconds!");
}, 2000);
```
Limitations of This Approach
1. Inefficiency:
  * setInterval runs continuously, even for longer delays, which might consume more resources compared to the native setTimeout().
2. Accuracy:
  * The timing is slightly less precise because it depends on the interval check and the execution time of the callback.
3. Browser Constraints:
  * For very short intervals (e.g., 1ms), browsers may throttle the interval to optimize performance, potentially causing minor inaccuracies.

Alternative Implementation Using Promises
For a cleaner and more modern approach, you can also simulate setTimeout() using JavaScript Promises.

```javascript
function customSetTimeout(callback, delay) {
  const promise = new Promise((resolve) => {
    const start = Date.now();
    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
      const elapsed = Date.now() - start;
      if (elapsed >= delay) {
        clearInterval(intervalId);
        resolve();
      }
    }, 1);
  });

  promise.then(callback);
}
```
Usage Example:
```javascript
customSetTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Executed after 3 seconds!");
}, 3000);
```

Real-World Use Case
Recreating setTimeout() can be useful in learning how JavaScript handles asynchronous operations under the hood. It also provides an opportunity to explore alternatives when built-in functions are not available in constrained environments.

This implementation helps solidify concepts like event loops, intervals, and time-based asynchronous execution.
